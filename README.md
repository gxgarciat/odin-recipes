<h1>Basic recipe website - TOP </h1>

<h2>This project is part of the TOP bootcamp.</h2>

<p>It consists of a basic recipe website.</p>
<p>For that purpose, it comprises of a main index page. In addition, links 
to different recipes will be added.</p>
<p>As this does not include any CSS knowledge, it will not look pretty.</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to use the HTML. To improve the apperance of this, we will 
revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.</p>
